# Logging Strategy

## 🎯 **Goal: Essential Logging Only**

Reduce log volume while maintaining observability for critical issues.

## ✅ **What TO Log**

### **1. Errors (Always Log)**
```python
# System errors, exceptions, failures
logger.log_error(e, {"operation": "translation", "user_id": user_id})
```

### **2. Critical Business Events**
```python
# Only significant business events
- User account deletion
- Large data operations (>10 items)
- Security events (auth failures)
- Payment events
```

### **3. Performance Issues**
```python
# Slow operations (>5 seconds)
- Translation taking too long
- Database queries timing out
- External API failures
```

### **4. Security Events**
```python
# Authentication/authorization issues
- Invalid tokens
- Permission denied
- Rate limit exceeded
```

## ❌ **What NOT to Log**

### **1. Routine Operations**
```python
# Don't log every successful operation
❌ logger.log_business_event("translation_completed", {...})  # Every translation
❌ logger.log_business_event("user_login", {...})            # Every login
❌ logger.log_business_event("storage_skipped", {...})       # Expected behavior
```

### **2. Expected Behavior**
```python
# Don't log normal, expected behavior
❌ Free user translation (no storage) - This is expected
❌ Successful API calls - Only log failures
❌ Routine database operations - Only log errors
```

### **3. High-Volume Events**
```python
# Don't log events that happen frequently
❌ Every translation request
❌ Every database read
❌ Every cache hit
```

## 📊 **Log Volume Impact**

### **Before (Excessive Logging):**
```
1M translations/month = 1M+ log entries
- translation_completed: 1M logs
- translation_skipped_storage: 800K logs (free users)
- user_translations_deleted: 1K logs
- Plus error logs
Total: ~2M+ log entries/month
```

### **After (Essential Logging):**
```
1M translations/month = ~1K log entries
- translation_completed: 0 logs (routine operation)
- translation_skipped_storage: 0 logs (expected behavior)
- user_translations_deleted: 100 logs (only significant deletions)
- Error logs: ~1K logs
Total: ~1K log entries/month
```

**Reduction: 99.95% fewer logs!**

## 🔧 **Implementation Guidelines**

### **SmartLogger Methods:**

#### **`log_error()` - Use For:**
- All exceptions and errors
- System failures
- External service failures
- Database errors

#### **`log_business_event()` - Use For:**
- Significant business events only
- Events that need analytics
- Security events
- Large operations (>10 items)

#### **`log_request()` / `log_response()` - Use For:**
- API Gateway level logging
- Performance monitoring
- Error responses

## 🎯 **Current Translation Service Logging**

### **✅ Kept (Essential):**
```python
# Error logging
logger.log_error(e, {"operation": "translation", "user_id": user_id})

# Significant deletions only
if deleted_count > 10:
    logger.log_business_event("user_translations_deleted", {...})
```

### **❌ Removed (Excessive):**
```python
# Routine operations
❌ logger.log_business_event("translation_completed", {...})  # Every translation
❌ logger.log_business_event("translation_skipped_storage", {...})  # Expected behavior
```

## 💰 **Cost Benefits**

### **CloudWatch Logs Costs:**
- **Ingestion**: $0.50 per GB
- **Storage**: $0.03 per GB per month
- **Analysis**: $0.005 per GB scanned

### **Cost Reduction:**
- **Before**: ~2GB/month = $1.06/month
- **After**: ~0.01GB/month = $0.005/month
- **Savings**: 99.5% cost reduction

## 🚀 **Best Practices**

1. **Log for Debugging**: Only log what you need to debug issues
2. **Log for Analytics**: Only log business events that need analysis
3. **Log for Security**: Always log security-related events
4. **Log for Performance**: Log slow operations and timeouts
5. **Don't Log Success**: Success is the expected state
6. **Use Structured Logging**: Include context in error logs
7. **Monitor Log Volume**: Set up alerts for unusual log spikes

## 📈 **Monitoring**

### **Key Metrics to Track:**
- Log volume per service
- Error rate
- Performance metrics
- Security events

### **Alerts to Set:**
- High error rate (>5%)
- Unusual log volume spikes
- Missing critical logs
- Performance degradation

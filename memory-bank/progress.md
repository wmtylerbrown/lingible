### üîç **Subscription Validation Issue for Account Deletion (2024-12-19)**
- **Issue Identified**: Users with expired subscriptions cannot delete accounts due to stale subscription data
- **Backend Problem**: `get_active_subscription()` only checks `status: "active"` field, ignores `end_date` expiration
- **iOS Problem**: Uses local cached StoreKit data (`Transaction.currentEntitlements`) instead of real-time Apple server queries
- **Root Cause**: Both systems rely on cached/stale data rather than validating current subscription status
- **Impact**: Legitimate account deletions blocked for users with expired but still "active" subscriptions
- **Analysis Completed**:
  - Backend validation logic analyzed in `user_account_deletion` handler
  - iOS validation logic analyzed in `ProfileView.swift` and `SubscriptionManager.swift`
  - Identified that `Transaction.currentEntitlements` uses local device receipt, not real-time Apple queries
- **Solution Options Identified**:
  1. **Backend Fix**: Add expiration date validation to `get_active_subscription()` method
  2. **iOS Fix**: Add Apple Receipt Validation API calls for real-time validation
  3. **Hybrid Approach**: Combine backend expiration checks with iOS Apple server validation
  4. **Graceful Degradation**: Allow account deletion with proper warnings and fallback validation
- **Recommended Implementation**:
  - Phase 1: Backend expiration date validation (quick fix, low risk)
  - Phase 2: iOS Apple receipt validation (enhanced user experience)
  - Phase 3: Full App Store Server API integration (comprehensive solution)
- **Status**: Analysis complete, solutions documented, ready for implementation

### ‚úÖ **Slang Crowdsourcing & LLM Validation System (2025-10-11)**
- **AI-Powered Validation**: Integrated Tavily web search + AWS Bedrock (Claude) for intelligent slang validation
- **Auto-Approval Flow**: High-confidence submissions (‚â•85%, usage score ‚â•7) automatically approved without human review
- **Community Voting**: Medium-confidence submissions go to community for upvoting before approval
- **Admin Controls**: Manual approve/reject endpoints for admin oversight with notifications on all submissions
- **Web Search Integration**: Tavily API provides real-time web evidence (Urban Dictionary, social media) to LLM for validation
- **User Statistics**: Track `slang_submitted_count` and `slang_approved_count` on user profiles for gamification/leaderboards
- **Cost Controls**: CloudWatch alarms for Bedrock usage, configurable auto-approval thresholds, web search result limits
- **New API Endpoints**:
  - `POST /slang/upvote/{submission_id}` - Community upvoting
  - `GET /slang/pending` - Retrieve validated submissions pending approval
  - `POST /slang/admin/approve/{submission_id}` - Admin approval
  - `POST /slang/admin/reject/{submission_id}` - Admin rejection
- **DynamoDB Architecture**: New GSI (`ValidationStatusIndex`) for efficient querying by validation status
- **Lambda Layer**: New `slang-validation` layer with `tavily-python` SDK for web search
- **Configuration System**: `SlangValidationConfig` with toggles for auto-approval, web search, and validation parameters
- **Immediate Validation**: LLM validation triggers immediately on submission (no queue/delay)
- **Complete Testing**: Comprehensive test suite with TDD approach
- **Client SDKs**: Python and Swift SDKs regenerated with new endpoints and user statistics fields

### ‚úÖ **Unified Secret Management System (2025-10-11)**
- **Single Management Script**: Consolidated `manage-apple-secret.js` and `manage-tavily-secret.js` into unified `manage-secrets.js`
- **Simplified Interface**: One command (`npm run secrets`) to manage all secrets across environments
- **List Command**: New `npm run secrets list <env>` command shows all secrets status at a glance
- **Secret Type Cleanup**: Removed unused `apple-shared-secret` (legacy StoreKit 1) and `apple-webhook-secret` (never implemented)
- **Active Secrets**: Only 3 secret types remain:
  - `apple-private-key` - Apple Sign-In authentication (Cognito)
  - `apple-iap-private-key` - App Store Server API (StoreKit 2 receipt validation + webhooks)
  - `tavily-api-key` - Slang validation web search
- **Documentation Updates**: Comprehensive README updates with new secret management workflow
- **Consistent Commands**: Uniform interface across all secret types (create, update, info, delete, list)
- **Better UX**: Clear indication of configured vs missing secrets for easier troubleshooting
- **Maintenance Reduction**: Single script reduces code duplication and maintenance burden
